# decline
The original decline was a 3rd party Hotline client for Mac OS X that I developed back in 2012.

The source code to the original version of decline for has long since disappeared into the ether but thatâ€™s probably a good thing since it was a buggy mess ðŸ˜…

But thankfully Iâ€™ve learned a few things since then and my vision of decline persists in this re-imagined version for modern macOS!

## core features
The following core features are currently **implemented** :

- Chat
- Private Messaging
- Plain News
- File Browsing
- File Downloads (stop/resume/queueing not yet working)

The following core features are currently **unimplemented** but planned :

- Threaded News
- File Uploads
- Folder Uploads
- Folder Downloads


## commands
The following commands are currently recognized by the Chat input field:

/icon [new icon number] 

> **Example**: /icon 148

/me [chat text to emote] 

> **Example**: /me is catching up on chat

/msg [nickname of user to message] [your private message]

> **Example**: /msg dubsdotla I am talking to myself

/nick [new nickname] 

> **Example**: /nick decline n00b



More commands are in the works!


## features unique to decline
- The option to show the Userlist on the right side of the Chat view
>   This is absolutely wild and groundbreaking I know, please contain your excitement
- Automatic saving and loading of chat and private messages
>   Okay so this one is a pretty killer feature, I probably should have started with this one ðŸ¤£

Thereâ€™s probably more that Iâ€™m forgetting but thatâ€™s all I have for now!
